Covers advanced NLP with Python, cleaning and vectoring data, word2vec, and neural networks.

The special skills recommended for this course are NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Jupyter Notebooks combine live code, explanatory text, visualizations, and equations in one package. They are an open document format based on JSON, which provides explanations and visuals for help.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Field concerned with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language.

NLP is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI).

NLP is used in:
- Search engines
- Spam filters
- Voice-activated assistants
- Machine translation
- Chatbots
- Sentiment analysis
- Spell checkers
- Grammar checkers
- Fraud detection
- Market intelligence
- sentence segmentation or part-of-speech tagging


Lambda function:
- A function that is defined without a name.
- Also known as an anonymous function.
- Can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
- The expression is evaluated and returned.
- Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.
- Lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
- Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition.
- Like nested function definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope.
# how is a lambda function different than a normal function?
